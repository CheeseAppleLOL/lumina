"""Chrome Companion local state: install record, profile pairing, socket path.

Stdlib-only; every function takes ``data_dir`` explicitly (Lumina passes
config.DATA_DIR; the installer CLI passes its required --data-dir), so this
module never imports config.

Layout (all owner-only; directories 0700, files 0600):

    <data_dir>/chrome_companion/install.json   extension origin + socket path
    <data_dir>/chrome_companion/pairing.json   the ONE enrolled extension instance
    <data_dir>/chrome_companion/native_host/   generated host config + launcher

Pairing exists because Native Messaging identifies an extension ID, not a
Chrome profile: the same unpacked extension loaded into a second profile has
the same ID. Each installed extension instance therefore generates a random
128-bit instance_id on first run (kept in chrome.storage.local), shows it in
its popup, and the owner enrolls exactly that instance with
``scripts/chrome_companion_setup.py pair <id>``. Pairing is never inferred from a
Google/Reddit/GitHub account, a tab title, a profile folder name, or an
email address. No credentials, cookies, or site tokens are stored here.

THE INSTALLER DOES NOT TRUST PATHNAMES (BROWSER-COMPANION-01A-R3 / B3-R3).
It trusts the directory objects it actually opened and verified, and it keeps
them open: every directory it writes into, reads from, or removes from is
reached by open_trusted_dir() -- a walk from "/" that opens ONE component at a
time, relative to the descriptor of the directory before it, with
O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW, and checks each object it opened with fstat() -- and
every write then goes through that same descriptor (write_file_at): a fresh,
randomly named temp created with O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW inside it, chmod-ed and
fsync-ed through its own descriptor, renamed over the target within the same
directory descriptor, and re-verified. Nothing is validated as a path string
and reopened later, so replacing any component of the path afterwards --
first ancestor, middle, or the final directory itself -- cannot move a write.

Accepted chain (_check_entry): every directory, and every symlink, the walk
passes through must be owned by root or this user; the directory it sits in
must be writable by nobody else -- group write only through a proven
user-private group (_private_group) -- unless that directory is sticky and
owned by root or this user (like /tmp), where nobody else can replace an
entry root or this user owns. A symlink is followed only under that rule
(the walk reads it with readlinkat and continues from the objects it opens,
up to 40 links); the final component of a directory written into is never a
link (a relocated data dir may be; the directories inside it may not).
The final directory must be owned by this user and writable by nobody else,
or, if private, accessible by nobody else. A hostile chain is refused, never
repaired.

THE WALK SEES THE PATH AS GIVEN (BROWSER-COMPANION-01A-R4 / AR4). Nothing
canonicalizes a data dir before the walk: resolve()/realpath() would replace
a link, and the directory holding it, with the target they pointed at in that
instant -- the walk would then vet only the target's ancestry and never see
the replaceable link. A relative path is only made absolute against the
working directory (absolute_path), with ".." left for the walk to take
physically, exactly as the kernel will when the recorded paths are used.
